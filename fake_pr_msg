The motivation came from reading Brett Cannon's article : https://snarky.ca/how-to-use-your-project-travis-to-help-test-python-itself/ .
Trying to activate the newest Python versions on CI jobs is in most cases a win-win situation:
 - if everything works fine, there is nothing to worry about.
 - if an issue is spotted, it is good to know about it to fix it on your side or to open a bug on CPython ( https://bugs.python.org/ ).

Also, if a failure is spotted, you can use the allow_failures option in your matrix build (more information about this in the link above).

Additional Travis tips:
 - to collect more data on the versions being used, you can use:
```
before_script:
- python -VV
- python -c "import sys; print(sys._git)" || true
```
 - to get your code run regularly, you can use Cron Jobs:
